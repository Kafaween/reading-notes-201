# there are 2 kind of tags

* Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs
* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such 
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
meaning of acronyms, and so on

* HTML has six "levels" of headings* 
from h1  to h6 

*By enclosing words in the tags 
b and /b we can make 
characters appear bold.*

*By enclosing words in the tags 
i and /i we can make 
characters appear italic.*


# CSS
## Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
> Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).

> Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.

> Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

> CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.


# Basic javascriptm

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 

Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 

Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 

JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

Expressions evaluate into a single value. 

Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

At the most basic level
we  can evaluate two variables using a 
comparison operator to return a 
t rue or f al se value. 


Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
