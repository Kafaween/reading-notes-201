# links

Links are created using the <a element.
  
> The a element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.
  
> If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
  
> You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.
  
> You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to
  
# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
  
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
  
  A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
