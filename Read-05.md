 # Images
 
 > The <img> element is used to add images to a 
web page.

> You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the 
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the 
content of an image.

> You should save images at the size you will be using 
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

> Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

 ## Three Rules for Creating Images
 * Save images in the right format
 
 * Save images at the right size
 
 * Use the correct resolution
 
 # Colors
 Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps 
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

Color pickers can help you find the color you want


# Text
There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.

If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.

You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented
