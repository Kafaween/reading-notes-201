# Images


## You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. 
This is very helpful when you use the same sized 
images on several pages of your site.

> Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically 
using CSS.

>  You can use a background image behind the box 
created by any element on a page.

>  Background images can appear just once or be 
repeated across the background of the box.

>  You can create image rollover effects by moving the 
background position of an image.

> To reduce the number of images your browser has to 
load, you can create image sprites

likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are 
coming to your site

names. Usually you will have to 
pay an annual fee to keep that 
domain name
## Web Hosting

your site, you will need to upload 
it to a web server. Web servers 
are special computers that are 
constantly connected to the 
Internet. They are specially set 

FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
