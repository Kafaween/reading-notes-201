CSS layouts enable developers to write really meaningful and robust styling rules with just a few keystrokes.
The talk above and this subsequent post examine 10 powerful lines of CSS that do some serious heavy lifting.

Programming languages make websites feel alive, but at the core of every web page stands the good old HTML.
When we discuss layouts, we must consider factors that make a good layout: responsiveness,
viewing ports, display devices, browsers, and users’ screen sizes.
A great layout not only looks great but can preserve the original intent by fitting in every possible display ratio.
This correction is produced through CSS. In this article, we will examine two powerful properties: CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid.




<div> elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page.
  
> Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
  
> The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
  
> Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
  
> Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
  and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
  
>  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
  
>  CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
  
>  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
