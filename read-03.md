> You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

> You can also control the borders, margin and padding 
for each box with CSS.

> It is possible to hide elements using the display and 
visibility properties.

> Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and 
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

# ARRAYS 
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

* var colors = ['white', 'black', ' custom']; *


INDEX VALUE 

|o |'white ' |

|1 |'bl ack'|

|2 |' custom'|


Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 

Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands. 

Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators. 

if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 

switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match). 

Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 

All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 

There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
